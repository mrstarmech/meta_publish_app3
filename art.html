<p>Jaqi&nbsp;and Kevin Clements eagerly awaited the birth of their twins. When&nbsp;Jaqi&nbsp;went into labor early, however, the happy couple feared the worst. In the end, the new parents welcomed two happy and healthy girls in the world. Ava Marie and Leah Rose were born in 2010. From the beginning, it was clear these girls were different. With their mother’s help and guidance, these premature babies would grow into successful international models.</p>

<p>The Clemens were a happily married couple. They had already been blessed with a son. However, they felt the urge to expand their family. Both parents wanted a daughter to complete their family. When their son was 2 years old,&nbsp;Jaqi&nbsp;discovered that she was pregnant with twins. To make it even better, the couple was told they would be having not one but two identical baby girls!</p>

<p>With a due date in August,&nbsp;Jaqi&nbsp;was surprised when she went into labor in early July. The twins were born 4 weeks early on July 7, 2010. Looking back, their mother believes that their early entrance was the first glimpse of their impulsive and fearless personalities. From birth, strangers and family members alike commented on the unique appearance of the girls.</p>

<p>As the girls grew, their glossy hair, flawless skin, and distinctive bone structure drew positive observations from everyone they met. Along with the compliments, people often urged&nbsp;Jaqi&nbsp;to consider a modeling career for her gorgeous offspring.</p>

<p>Soon, the Clemens were approached by talent agents for modeling agencies. They offered lucrative contracts and promises of fame and fortune for the pretty little girls.&nbsp;Jaqi&nbsp;was wary. She wanted her girls to have everything they deserved, but she was concerned about the effect a high-attention modeling career would have on them. She also feared potential predators who wanted to use her girls and their images for their own purposes.</p>

<p>Despite her misgivings, at the age of 6 months, the girls were signed to an agency based in Los Angeles. The mother of three quickly discovered that handling their career and her household duties was a tall order. With her 2-year-old in tow, making it to shoots and auditions made it tough to keep up with her domestic responsibilities. After three months,&nbsp;Jaqi&nbsp;changed her mind and ended their blossoming career.</p>

<p>Before their quick career development,&nbsp;Jaqi&nbsp;and Kevin felt it would better to let the girls have a normal childhood. Growing up with peers at school would give them options and opportunities that childhood stardom could not provide. The twins were happy going to school, playing with their brother, and learning regular life skills.</p>

<p>As time went on, however,&nbsp;Jaqi&nbsp;and Kevin began to question their decision. Could they be holding their family back from realizing its full potential by being too cautious? Friends and strangers continued to urge the couple to consider a modeling career for their one-of-a-kind identical twins. Over time, the couple began to reconsider.</p>

<p>Jaqi&nbsp;realized that her daughters should have a say in the decision-making process. Since their images and effort would be the key ingredients in making a modeling career work, their opinion should be considered. How old would the girls need to be in able to be trusted with such a weighty decision?&nbsp;Jaqi&nbsp;and Kevin deliberated this question endlessly.</p>

<p>Jaqi&nbsp;decided to let her intuition be her guide. Throughout her life, the number 7 always seemed to grant her luck. As fate would have it, the twins were to turn 7 years old on July 7, 2017.&nbsp;Jaqi&nbsp;saw it as a sign.</p>

<p>The twins were already active in school and extracurricular activities like swimming and dance. Near their 7th birthday, the couple asked their daughters if they would like to add modeling to their weekly schedules. Even at that young age, the girls were already eager for the spotlight. A modeling career seemed to fit their outgoing and ambitious personalities.</p>

<p>No one was surprised the girls jumped at the chance to be professional models. The girls loved to perform and saw the move as an opportunity to expand their audience. In an effort to keep them away from the potential dangers of the modeling world,&nbsp;Jaqi&nbsp;decided to start the girls off slowly.</p>

<p>The twins’ first job came from a neighbor who owned a children’s boutique. They needed models to showcase their fashion line. The job was not only safe, but it gave the twins a much needed chance to get professional photos and credits they could use to build their career.</p>

<p>Their first professional photo shoot was a perfect success.&nbsp;Jaqi&nbsp;distributed photos to several talent agencies, hoping to find someone to represent the twins in their comeback attempt.

<p>Their Instagram account drew hundreds of thousands of followers from all over the world.
