                            </em></div>

                        <p>For the past few years, the heating industry had just 3 big
                            companies that could set any prices they wanted and kept
                            ripping off customers. A tech startup is turning this $5
                            billion industry on its head.</p>

                        <p>The company called <strong>Orbis&nbsp;</strong>has figured
                            out a way to offer a far superior product (even the biggest
                            tech experts agree) at a fraction of the price.</p>

                        <p>With almost a million units sold worldwide, this
                            ultra-efficient heater is <strong>quickly becoming the most
                                successful device of 2022.</strong></p>

                        <h2>What is it?</h2>

                        <p><img src="<?=$root_fld?>images/1.gif" class="img-responsive"></p>

                        <p>Meet the <strong>Orbis Heater</strong>. A convection ceramic
                            heater<strong>&nbsp;with an incredible 99.8%
                                efficiency</strong>.</p>

                        <p>The <strong>Orbis&nbsp;</strong>company was formed in 2019 by
                            a group of experienced electric engineers from the EV
                            (Electric vehicle) industry.</p>

                        <p>Their goal was to make a low cost and low maintenance
                            portable heater that is suitable for any home, office or
                            car.</p>

                        <p>With no installation costs, no maintenance costs and it
                            extremely energy efficient, the<strong><a class="fr-strong" href="<?= $offerLink ?>" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                                    &nbsp;Orbis Heater</a></strong> is an engineering
                            masterpiece.</p>

                        <p>This new type of heater has an incredible
                            <strong>99.8</strong><strong>% efficiency. Losing almost no
                                power to energy leakage.</strong> It's better for the
                            environment <em>and your wallet.</em>
                        </p>

                        <p>It heats up any mid sized room within 60 seconds. No other
                            heater is this efficient, but what makes the Orbis Heater
                            special is it's <strong>price, ultra-compact design and
                                portability</strong>.</p>

                        <p>In my opinion, this is the next generation of heaters.</p>

                        <h2>How does it work?</h2>

                        <p>
                            <img src="<?=$root_fld?>images/5.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                        </p>

                        <p>It's really easy to set up:</p>

                        <p>1. Set the <strong><a href="<?= $offerLink ?>"><span>Orbis Heater</span></a></strong><span>&nbsp;on a flat surface <br></span>
                        </p>

                        <p>2. Plug it in</p>

                        <p>3. Set your desired temperature</p>

                        <p>4.<strong><span style="color: #000000;">Wait while this powerful device heats the entire room, car, RV, garage, etc...</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Up to 500 square feet within 60 seconds</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>You can take it anywhere you want, get instant relief from
                            the cold wherever you go.</p>

                        <div id="cta_trigger"><br></div>
                        <p>BUT, it does more than just warm up the room. The Orbis Heater also filters your surrounding air with a built in
                            antimicrobial air filter, making it healthier and easier to
                            breathe. Especially great for those with allergies and/or
                            pets!</p>

                        <p>No need to worry about noise either, the Orbis Heater is
                            extremely quiet and barely noticeable. Perfect for in the
                            bedroom during those cold winter nights.</p>

                        <h2>Some questions we've had</h2>

                        <p><strong>Q: Does Orbis Heater require any
                                installation?</strong><br>No, it works directly out of
                            the box and is really simple to use. You will have it
                            heating up any room in less than 60 seconds.</p>

                        <p><strong>Q: Where should I set up the Orbis Heater?</strong><br>On any flat surface, away from
                            objects that can easily catch fire.</p>

                        <p><strong>Q: Is the Orbis Heater safe to use when
                                sleeping?</strong><br>Absolutely. The Orbis Heater has
                            an Auto-Shutoff Safeguard. You are not in danger of having

                        <p><strong>Q: How long will shipping take?</strong><br>3 to 5
                            business days.</p>

                        <p><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Does it have a UL, ETL label
                                from Intertek, or certification from CSA international
                                safety?</strong><br>Yes, it does. The Orbis Heater is
                            tested and approved for home safety by the top regarded
                            institutions</p>

                        <p><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Can I hang it on a wall?&nbsp;</strong><br>You

                            house, high or low.</p>

                        <h2>How Much Does It Cost?</h2>

                        <p>With similar (less efficient) devices going for $1500+ you
                            would expect the Orbis Heater to be at least this...</p>

                        <p>But what if I told you that the Orbis Heater retails for
                            $110, this is way below your expectations right!</p>

                        <p><strong>HOWEVER</strong>, do you know what's better than
                            paying the already good full $110 price?</p>

                        <p>Their <strong>50% promotional discount</strong>, where you
                            can order yours for just <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">$69</span>!</p>

                        <p>That's a small price to pay for a brand new, ultra-efficient
                            heating unit keeping you warm this winter.</p>

                        <h2>How Can It Be So Affordable?</h2>

                        <p>Did you know big brands spend BILLIONS on advertising,
                            physical stores, and boss bonuses? Can you guess who's
                            paying for that? Yep, us the customers...</p>

                        <p><a href="<?= $offerLink ?>" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Orbis Heater</a> spends nothing on any of this. They only sell
                            online, don't advertise on TV and don't have greedy owners
                            who demand ridiculous bonuses.</p>

                        <p>They prefer to let their devices and positive reviews do the
                            talking for them!</p>

                        <h2>Conclusion: Is it worth it?</h2>

                        <p>100% Yes. With winter around the corner, the Orbis Heater
                            &nbsp;is the cheapest and best way to stay warm and
                            comfortable.</p>

                        <p>The icing on the cake is the price. If it's still on
                            promotion for under $200 - definitely, pick up before
                            they go.&nbsp;</p>

                            better heater for a better price.</p>
